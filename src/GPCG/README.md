GPCG Game
Created to facilitate learning skills related to several aspects of Java coding for FRC Robotics:
- Basic programming skills
- Structure of a Java project
- Collaboration and use of git
- JavaFX library
- Writing methods for Java programs
- Variable types
- Communication between classes
The GPC Game project is an interactive multiplayer game where players (FRC Teams) "sell" their FRC team uniforms, trying to raise "funds" for their robotics teams.  Each round of the game, approximately 1000000 customers purchase one item from one of the teams.  The higher the price set by the team, the fewer sales will be made.  The winning team will have accumulated the greatest profit after five rounds of the game.  Further details about game play are available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pwpLrS3Tba9WXKOcEX4rBD6GbZU_i41des-CgO4yNIo/edit?usp=sharing).
